# Deployment
### Overview
The full stack application is deployed via AWS ECS with self-managed EC2 instances using an automated Jenkins pipeline. Below is an overview of the steps required to do so:  
- Dockerfiles are used to create docker images of both the frontend and backend. These images are uploaded to AWS Elastic Container Repository (ECR)
- An Elastic Container Service (ECS) cluster is created and utilized as a container orchestration and management tool
- The ECS deploys both the frontend and backend images to containers which run on two different EC2 instances

### Implementation
#### Configure AWS 
Prior to running the Jenkins pipeline, AWS must be configured as outlined below.<br/> 
<b>Note:</b> These configuration steps only need to be completed once.
- ECR (Elastic Container Repository)
  - Create lg-backend repository
  - Create lg-frontend repository
- ECS (Elastic Container Service)
  - Create Cluster

#### Configure Jenkins
Jenkins must be configured to allow you to run the pipeline. <br/>
<b>Note:</b> Jenkins must be installed on your system and the application launched. Download all standard plugins when prompted during install.
1. Navigate to the port specified during installation (i.e., localhost:8080)
2. Sign in with your credentials
3. Navigate to `Dashboard`->`Manage Jenkins`->`Plugin Manager` and download the following plugins:
   1. CloudBees AWS Credentials Plugin
   2. Docker: Docker API, Commons, Pipeline and plugin Plugins
   3. AWS: EC2 + SDK, ECR + SDK, ECS SDK and IAM SDK plugins
4. Navigate to `Dashboard`->`Manage Jenkins`->`Credentials` and enter in the following credentials:
   1. github_PAT
   2. jenkins-aws-admin
   3. jenkins-aws-s3
5. In the dashboard click `New Item`, select `Pipeline` and enter a pipeline name (e.g., LogGenPipeline)
6. Navigate to `Dashboard`->`LogGenPipeline`->`Configure` and enter the following configurations:
   1. `GitHub project`->`Project url`: https://github.com/andymbwu/log-generator
   2. `Pipeline`
      1. `Definition`: Pipeline script from SCM
      2. `SCM`: Git
      3. `Repository URL`: https://github.com/andymbwu/log-generator
      4. `Branches to build`->`Branch Specifier (blank for 'any')`: */main

4. The full stack application is now launched and can be accessed by the EC2 instance URLs + port number + API address (applicable to backend)
   1. For example, frontendURL to landing page: http://ec2-52-38-219-170.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/
   2. For example, backendURL to stats API: http://ec2-100-20-95-225.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/api/v1/generate/stats
