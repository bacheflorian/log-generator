## Configuring Loglines To Be Generated

- Repeating Loglines
  - Enter the percentage chance that a log will be duplicated
- Field Settings  
  Select which fields to include in the generated logs. Each field will be randomly generated unless values are specified to be used. To provide multiple values separate them with a comma.
  - `Time stamp`
  - `Processing time`
  - `Current user ID`
  - `Business GUID`
  - `Path to file`
  - `File SHA256`
  - `Disposition`
- Custom Logs
  ![customLogs](documentation\readme-assets\customLogs.gif) <br/>
  The custom logs will be generated at the frequency specified. Custom logs will always contain the values that were specified for the fields. If a value for the field isn’t specified, it will be generated randomly or with the given field values.
  - `Edit` - press the edit button <br/>
    - In the pop-up window, add custom logs directly, or load from text or a json file
    - Additional fields can be added by specifing them in the json file or text box
    - Download button available to download the custom logs as a json file

## Selecting a Mode

- Stream mode
  ![Stream](documentation\readme-assets\stream.gif) <br/>
  - Stream Address: Specify a `Stream Address` to stream to
  - Log Rate: Specify a `log rate` in logs/s. Select 0 or -1 for maximum rate available
  - Save logs: Select the checkbox if you'd like to save the streamed logs to file (S3 bucket)
  - Click `Start`
- Batch mode
  ![Batch](documentation\readme-assets\batch.gif) <br/>
  - Number of Logs: Specify the number of logline to be included in the batch file
  - Click `Start`

## Configuring Stream Address Endpoint

Log lines will be streamed to the address provided by sending HTTP POST requests. The endpoint will receive an array of up to 10 logs in JSON format with each request. The frequency of requests will be approximately the log rate specified divided by 10. All logs sent by a given job will have the same fields and contain information such as a timestamp, file path, and processing time. The endpoint should return a success or error response based on the outcome of the request. Streaming will be stopped upon receiving an error response or being cancelled.

```
POST /api/endpoint HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

# Deployment

## Overview

The full stack application is deployed via AWS ECS with self-managed EC2 instances using an automated Jenkins pipeline. Below is an overview of the steps required to do so:

- Dockerfiles are used to create docker images of both the frontend and backend. These images are uploaded to AWS Elastic Container Repository (ECR)
- An Elastic Container Service (ECS) cluster is created and utilized as a container orchestration and management tool
- The ECS deploys both the frontend and backend images to containers which run on two different EC2 instances

## Configure AWS

Prior to running the Jenkins pipeline, AWS must be configured as outlined below.<br/>
<b>Note:</b> These configuration steps only need to be completed once.

- ECR (Elastic Container Repository)
  - Create lg-backend repository
  - Create lg-frontend repository

## Configure Jenkins

Jenkins must be configured to allow you to run the pipeline. <br/>
<b>Note:</b> Jenkins must be installed on your system and the application launched. Download all standard plugins when prompted during install.

1. Navigate to the port specified during installation (i.e., localhost:8080)
2. Sign in with your credentials
3. Navigate to `Dashboard`->`Manage Jenkins`->`Plugin Manager` and download the following plugins:
   1. CloudBees AWS Credentials Plugin
   2. Docker: Docker API, Commons, Pipeline and plugin Plugins
   3. AWS: EC2 + SDK, ECR + SDK, ECS SDK and IAM SDK plugins
4. Navigate to `Dashboard`->`Manage Jenkins`->`Credentials` and enter in the following credentials:
   1. github_PAT
   2. jenkins-aws-admin
   3. jenkins-aws-s3
5. In the dashboard click `New Item`, select `Pipeline` and enter a pipeline name (e.g., LogGenPipeline)
6. Navigate to `Dashboard`->`LogGenPipeline`->`Configure` and enter the following configurations:
   1. `GitHub project`->`Project url`: https://github.com/andymbwu/log-generator
   2. `Pipeline`
      1. `Definition`: Pipeline script from SCM
      2. `SCM`: Git
      3. `Repository URL`: https://github.com/andymbwu/log-generator
      4. `Branches to build`->`Branch Specifier (blank for 'any')`: \*/main
      5. `Script Path`: JenkinsFile

## Deploy the full stack application

To deploy the full stack application for the first time or for future updates follow the steps outlined below:

1. Open the Docker Desktop Application on your computer
2. Launch Jenkins
3. Run the pipeline by navigating to `Dashboard`->`LogGenPipeline` and selected `Build Now`
   ![Jenkins1](documentation\readme-assets\jenkins_buildNow.png)
4. The full stack application is now launched and can be accessed by the EC2 instance URLs + port number + API address (applicable to backend)
   1. For example, frontendURL to landing page: http://ec2-52-38-219-170.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/
   2. For example, backendURL to stats API: http://ec2-100-20-95-225.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/api/v1/generate/stats
